            <dt>J Balvin</dt>
            <dd>José Álvaro Osorio Balvín (born 7 May 1985), known professionally as J Balvin, 
                is a Colombian singer and rapper. He has been referred to as the "Prince of 
                Reggaeton" (from Spanish: "Príncipe del Reggaetón"),[2][3] and is one of the 
                best-selling Latin music artists with sales of more than 35 million records 
                (albums and singles) worldwide.[4] Balvin was born in Medellín, Colombia. 
                At age 17, he moved to the United States to learn English, where he lived in 
                both Oklahoma and New York. He then returned to Medellín and gained popularity 
                performing at clubs in the city.
                <dt>1985–2013: Early life and career beginnings</dt>
                <dd>Balvin was born into a middle-class family in Medellín, Colombia, on 7 May 1985.
                    [11][12] His father was an economist and business owner, and he grew up in a larg
                    e home in the hills outside the city.[13] He grew up listening to rock groups such
                     as Metallica and Nirvana, and states that he incorporates the grunge aesthetic in
                     to his personal style, having a Nirvana tattoo on his knee.[14] He developed an i
                     nterest in reggaeton after listening to Daddy Yankee. He recalls that "I was such
                      a fan that I was copying his style, the way he moved onstage, his flows, his rap
                      s," comparing him to the reggaeton equivalent of Jay-Z.[12] His father's busines
                      s went bankrupt, and the family lost their home and car, requiring the family t
                      o move to a poorer neighborhood. During this period of his life, Balvin notes, 
                      "When I would go to the barrio, people saw me as a rich person, but when I'm ar
                      ound rich people they see me as someone from the ghetto. It's all perceptions.
                       I like moving between worlds. I feel equally comfortable in both."[13]</dd>
